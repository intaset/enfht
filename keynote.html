  <p class="body">Prof Panagiota Angeli specializes on complex multiphase flows and their application to process intensification in energy and manufacturing. She received her Diploma in Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens in 1990, and her PhD from Imperial College London in 1992. She joined the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCL in 1996.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof Angeli was guest editor of the Nuclear Process Engineering Special Issue in <i>ChERD</i> (2013) and was awarded a Leverhulme/RAEng Senior Research Fellowship in 2011. She participates in UK Research Council (EPSRC) and international (Norway, Sweden) research funding review panels, and was appointed Visiting Professor for Multiphase Flows in A* Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore. Her work has been supported by EPSRC and European Union grants and industrial funding (Chevron, GSK, Xaar). She is co-Investigator in the EPSRC flagship project MEMPHIS on multiphase flows and is leading the EPSRC project CORAL on future formulation of complex products. Prof Angeli  is currently co-chair of the Multiphase Flows Special Interest Group of the UK Fluids Network. She has published over 130 peer reviewed journal and conference papers.</p>
