  <p class="body">BC Khoo graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA (Honours, 1st Class with Distinction). In 1984, he obtained his MEng from the NUS and followed by PhD from MIT in 1989. He joined NUS in 1989.</p>

  <p class="body">From 1998 to 1999, he was seconded to the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC, Singapore) and served as the deputy Director and Director of Research.</p>

  <p class="body">In 1999, BC returned to NUS and spent time at the SMA-I (Singapore MIT Alliance I) as the co-Chair of High Performance Computation for Engineered Systems Program till 2004. In the period 2005-2013, under the SMA-II, he was appointed as the co-Chair of Computational Engineering Program.</p>

  <p class="body">In 2011-2012, BC was appointed the Director of Research, Temasek Laboratories, NUS. Since 2012, he has been the Director, Temasek Laboratories.</p>

  <p class="body">BC Khoo serves on numerous organizing and advisory committees for International Conferences/Symposiums held in USA, China, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and others. He is a member of the Steering Committee, HPC (High Performance Computing) Asia. He has received a Defence Technology Team Prize (1998, Singapore) and the prestigious Royal Aeronautical Prize (1980, UK). Among other numerous and academic and professional duties, he is the Associate Editor of <i>Communications in Computational Physics (CiCP)</i> and <i>Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (AAMM)</i>, and is on the Editorial Board of <i>American Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Ocean Systems Engineering (IJOSE), International Journal of Intelligent Unmanned Systems (IJIUS), The Open Mechanical Engineering Journal (OME)</i> and <i>The Open Ocean Engineering Journal.</i> </p>

  <p class="body">In research, BC ‘s interest are in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(i) Fluid-structure interaction</li>
    <li>(ii)  Underwater shock and bubble dynamics</li>
    <li>(iii) Compressible/Incompressible multi-medium flow0</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="body">He is the PI of numerous externally funded projects including those from the Defense agencies like ONR/ONR Global and MINDEF (Singapore) to simulate/study the dynamics of underwater explosion bubble(s), flow supercavitation and detonation physics. His work on water circulation and transport across the turbulent air-sea interface has received funding from the then BP International for predicting the effects of accidental chemical spills. Qatar NRF has funded study on internal sloshing coupled to external wave hydrodynamics of (large) LNG carrier.</p> 
  <p class="body">BC has published over 350 international journal papers, and over 360 papers at international conferences/symposiums. He has presented at over 100 plenary/keynote/invited talks at international conferences/symposiums/meetings.</p>
