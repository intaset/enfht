  <p class="body">He studied mechanical engineering with specialization in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Since 1991 he has worked at the University Erlangen-Nuremberg in the Institute of Fluid Mechanics. In 1996 he finished his doctor thesis with the topic “Flow around bluff bodies in wall boundary layers”.  During 1997/1998 he had a research stay at the INEEL, USA (Department of Energy), Lookheed Martin. After finishing his habilitation thesis “ Measurements and their Applications for Turbulence Characterization of Wall Mounted Flows”. </p>
  <p class="body">Now Stefan Becker is head of research and leader of the group Fluid System Dynamics and Aeroacoustic at the Institute of Process Machinery and Systems Engineering at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. His special research interests include aerodynamics, fluid-structure interaction, fluid-structure-acoustic interaction, and measurement techniques. He also heads the special interest group aeroacoustic of the German Acoustical Society (DEGA) and is member of the management Board and coordinator of the pilot center south of the European Research Community on Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (ERCOFTAC). At the moment several research projects from European Union, German/Bavarian Research Foundation, and long-term industrial projects are dealt with in his research group involving development and application of experimental and numerical techniques as well. He published more than 50 revised international journal publications.</p>
