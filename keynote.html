  <p class="body">Dr. Afshin J. Ghajar is <i>Regents and John Brammer Endowed Professor</i> in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA and an Honorary Professor of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China. He received his BS, MS, and PhD all in Mechanical Engineering from Oklahoma State University. His expertise is in experimental heat transfer/fluid mechanics and development of practical engineering correlations. Dr. Ghajar has made significant contributions to the field of thermal sciences through his experimental, empirical, and numerical works in heat transfer and stratification in sensible heat storage systems, heat transfer to non-Newtonian fluids, heat transfer in the transition region, and non-boiling heat transfer in two-phase flow. His current research is in two-phase flow heat transfer/ pressure drop studies in pipes with different orientations, heat transfer/pressure drop in mini/micro tubes, and mixed convective heat transfer/pressure drop in the transition region (plain and enhanced tubes). Dr. Ghajar has been a Summer Research Fellow at Wright Patterson AFB (Dayton, Ohio) and Dow Chemical Company (Freeport, Texas). He and his co-workers have published over 200 reviewed research papers and 10 book/handbook chapters. He has delivered numerous keynote and invited lectures at major technical conferences and institutions. </p>

  <p class="body">He has received several outstanding teaching, research, advising, and service awards from College of Engineering at Oklahoma State University. His latest significant awards are the 75thAnniversary Medal of the ASME Heat Transfer Division "<i>in recognition of his service to the heat transfer community and contributions to the field</i>", awarded in 2013, the ASME ICNMM 2016 Outstanding Leadership Award, this award recognizes a person whose service within the ICNMM (International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels, and Minichannels) is exemplary; and the 2017 Donald Q. Kern Award “<i>in recognition of his outstanding leadership in the field of heat exchangers and two-phase flow, book and archival publications, and service to the academic and industrial professionals</i>”. Dr. Ghajar is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), <i>Heat Transfer Series Editor</i> for CRC Press/Taylor & Francis (he has edited ten books to date), and <i>Editor-in-Chief of Heat Transfer Engineering</i>, an international journal published twenty times per year by Taylor and Francis. <i>Heat Transfer Engineering</i> is aimed at practicing engineers and specialists in heat transfer. Dr. Ghajar is also the co-author of the 5<sup>th</sup> Edition of Cengel and Ghajar, <u><i>Heat and Mass Transfer – Fundamentals and Applications</i></u>, McGraw-Hill, 2015. The 6<sup>th</sup> edition is in press and will be available in 2019. </p>

  <p class="body">BC Khoo graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA (Honours, 1st Class with Distinction). In 1984, he obtained his MEng from the NUS and followed by PhD from MIT in 1989. He joined NUS in 1989.</p>

  <p class="body">From 1998 to 1999, he was seconded to the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC, Singapore) and served as the deputy Director and Director of Research.</p>

  <p class="body">In 1999, BC returned to NUS and spent time at the SMA-I (Singapore MIT Alliance I) as the co-Chair of High Performance Computation for Engineered Systems Program till 2004. In the period 2005-2013, under the SMA-II, he was appointed as the co-Chair of Computational Engineering Program.</p>

  <p class="body">In 2011-2012, BC was appointed the Director of Research, Temasek Laboratories, NUS. Since 2012, he has been the Director, Temasek Laboratories</p>

  <p class="body">BC Khoo serves on numerous organizing and advisory committees for International Conferences/Symposiums held in USA, China, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and others. He is a member of the Steering Committee, HPC (High Performance Computing) Asia. He has received a Defence Technology Team Prize (1998, Singapore) and the prestigious Royal Aeronautical Prize (1980, UK). Among other numerous and academic and professional duties, he is the Associate Editor of <i>Communications in Computational Physics (CiCP) and Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (AAMM),</i> and is on the Editorial Board of <i>American Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Ocean Systems Engineering (IJOSE), International Journal of Intelligent Unmanned Systems (IJIUS), The Open Mechanical Engineering Journal (OME) and The Open Ocean Engineering Journal.</i>  </p>

  <p class="body">In research, BC ‘s interest are in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(i) Fluid-structure interaction</li>
    <li>(ii)  Underwater shock and bubble dynamics</li>
    <li>(iii) Compressible/Incompressible multi-medium flow</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="body">He is the PI of numerous externally funded projects including those from the Defense agencies like ONR/ONR Global and MINDEF (Singapore) to simulate/study the dynamics of underwater explosion bubble(s), flow supercavitation and detonation physics. His work on water circulation and transport across the turbulent air-sea interface has received funding from the then BP International for predicting the effects of accidental chemical spills. Qatar NRF has funded study on internal sloshing coupled to external wave hydrodynamics of (large) LNG carrier. </p>
